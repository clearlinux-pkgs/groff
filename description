Groff (GNU troff) is a typesetting system that reads plain text mixed with
formatting commands and produces formatted output. Output may be PostScript or
PDF, HTML, or ASCII/UTF-8 for display at the terminal. Formatting commands may
be either low-level typesetting requests ("primitives") or macros from a
supplied set. Users may also write their own macros. All three may be combined.
